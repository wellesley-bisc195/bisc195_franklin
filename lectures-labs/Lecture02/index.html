Much of the software written in julia, including the entire programming language itself is available for free - often both <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/31717/what-do-the-phrases-free-speech-vs.-free-beer-really-mean/">free as in beer and free as in speech</a>.</p> <p>That software is often available on github or gitlab, and you can download it, make changes, and if you like, request that your changes are &quot;merged&quot; into the main repository so that others can benefit. Minor changes and changes from beginners are often welcomed, even encouraged.</p> <p>I&#39;ve learned a TON from doing this in open source repositories - many times people have spent considerably more time helping me accomplish some thing than it would have taken for them to just do it themselves &#40;<a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/29679">here&#39;s an example</a>&#41;.</p> <p>The process I describe here is pretty common for contributing to open source projects - let&#39;s get started&#33;</p> <h3 id=step_1_-_fork_and_clone_the_repository ><a href="#step_1_-_fork_and_clone_the_repository" class=header-anchor >Step 1 - Fork and clone the repository</a></h3> <p>The first step is to &quot;fork&quot; the repository to your own github account.</p> <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UT9xwFl.png" alt="Fork repo" /></p> <p>You should see a copy of the repo under your own github account &#40;1&#41; that is forked from the main repo. Then, as you did with <a href="/assignments/Assignment01">assignment 1</a>, copy the repository link by clicking the green &quot;code&quot; button &#40;2&#41;. Be sure to use the link to your fork &#40;3&#41;, rather than the main repo&#41;</p> <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/I6o8zBM.png" alt="get repo url" /></p> <p>Clone the repo using that URL</p> <pre><code class=language-sh >&#36; git clone &lt;your repo url&gt;</code></pre>
<h3 id=step_2_-_make_your_changes_and_push ><a href="#step_2_-_make_your_changes_and_push" class=header-anchor >Step 2 - Make your changes and push</a></h3>
<p>Make a new &quot;branch&quot; to hold your changes using <code>git checkout -b &lt;branchname&gt;</code>. This ensures that, as you make changes, it&#39;s always easy to get back to the original. This isn&#39;t strictly necessary, but it&#39;s good practice, and in longer development workflows, sometimes there are more changes to <code>main</code> before you get to them, which can cause merge conflicts if you&#39;re not careful.</p>
<p>Then, use VS code or some other method to make your changes. Be sure to add yourself as an author to the <code>README.md</code> file &#40;if you want&#41;&#33; Though actually, git will track the changes that you&#39;ve made, and you&#39;ll retain credit regardless.</p>
<p>Commit your changes as you make them. Then <code>push</code> them - because you have a new branch, you need to tell <code>git</code> where it should go. Do this using <code>git push --set-upstream origin &lt;branchname&gt;</code> &#40;remember, <code>origin</code> is the default name of your <code>remote</code>&#41;.</p>
<p>&#40;note - in this video, I use a terminal editor called <code>nano</code> to make the edits, just so that you can see that in the terminal video&#41;.</p>

<script id=asciicast-wCmuOGnTxCo1JyZFE6dZsuoh4  src="https://asciinema.org/a/wCmuOGnTxCo1JyZFE6dZsuoh4.js" async></script>

<h3 id=step_3_-_open_a_pull_request ><a href="#step_3_-_open_a_pull_request" class=header-anchor >Step 3 - Open a &quot;Pull request&quot;</a></h3>
<p>On Github, signaling that you have changes that can be merged into the primary branch is called a &quot;Pull request&quot; &#40;often shortened to &quot;PR&quot;&#41;. When you&#39;ve forked a repo, and made changes, guthub will give you a handy prompt that you can make a PR with your new changes.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/AiFwuXz.png" alt="start PR" /></p>
<p>Click the big green button and follow the prompts. I may ask you to make some changes or add new things. As you do, keep pushing to the same branch &#40;you can just do <code>git push</code> from now on&#41;, and the PR will be automatically updated.</p>
<p>Congratulations&#33; You&#39;re contributing to open source&#33;</p>
