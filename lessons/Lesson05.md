## Repeating code with loops

Writing code is about being lazy -
never write more code than you have to!
We've already seen that we can use functions
to wrap up code that can then be used over and over and over and...

But there are plenty more opportunities for re-using code,
especially "loops."
In the üê¢exercise from [Chapter 4](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html#chap04)
you've seen one use of the `for` loop.

```julia
for i in 1:5
    println(i * 3)
end
```

This loop says, "For each number, 1 to 5, print that number times 3."

The way the computer evaluates this is as a loop -

1. `i` is set to 1, `println(i * 3)`
    1. loop back to the top
2. `i` is set to 2, `println(i * 3)`
    1. loop back to the top
3. etc...

### Using ranges in `for` loops

The `1:5` is a "range", it's all of the integers from 1 to 5.
In julia, there are many ways to express ranges -
and they don't always have to increment by 1!

The easiest way to use ranges is with the `:` syntax,
`<start>:<optional-increment>:<end>`.

```julia
for even_number in 2:2:10
    println(even_number)
end

for half in 1:0.5:3
    println(half)
end
```

You can even go backwards!

```julia
function decrement(n)
    for d in n:-1:0
        println(d)
    end
end

decrement(5)
```

In the examples above, I'm writing these in "script notation"
rather than "REPL" notation (note the absence of the `julia> ` prompt).

But you can (and should!) copy the code into a REPL
or evaluate it in VS-code to see the results.
Try to predict what the outcome will be *before* you run it,
and if the results aren't what you expect, look into why.
@@

For more complicated ranges, we can also use the `range()` function.
Use the REPL `help?` mode to learn about the `range` function
by typing `?` (the prompt should change to `help?>`),
then type `range` and press `enter`.

```julia-repl
help?> range
# ...
```

Use the `range()` function to make a range
that goes from `10` to `1000` with 4 entries.

You should be able to run:

```julia-repl

            println(i)
       end
10.0
340.0
670.0
1000.0
```
@@

### While loops

In many cases,
the same loop can be written in many different ways.
For example,

```julia
function whiledecrement(n)
    while n >= 0 # greater than or equal to
        println(n)
        n = n - 1
    end
end

whiledecrement(5)
```

Where `for` loops march through a predetermined sequence,
`while` loops continue until a particular condition is met.

### Loops and scope

In julia, loops have their own scope
(we talked about [scope back in Lesson 3](/lessons/Lesson03/#variables_arguments_and_scope)).
Functions also have their own scope,
and the way that the scope of loops and the scope of functions interact
can be a bit counter-intuitive.

The best way to get a sense of this is to see some examples.

```julia-repl
julia> i = 5
5

julia> for i in 1:3
           println(i)
       end
1
2
3

julia> println(i)
5
```

```julia-repl
julia> function strangeloop(j)
           k = 1
           for k in 1:j
               println(k)
           end
           println(k)
       end
strangeloop (generic function with 1 method)

julia> k = 5
5

julia> strangeloop(k)
1
2
3
4
5
1

julia> println(k)
5
```

```julia-repl
julia> m = 3
3

julia> while m > 0
           print("$m ")
           m = m - 1
       end
3 2 1

julia> m
0
```

Note that here, the REPL behaves differently
than the same code in a julia file.

Put the code above (without the `julia>` prompts)
into a file called "scope.jl" and execute it.

```julia-repl
julia> include("scope.jl")
‚îå Warning: Assignment to `m` in soft scope is ambiguous because a global variable by the same name exists: `m` will be treated as a new local. Disambiguate by using `local m` to suppress this warning or `global m` to assign to the existing global variable.
‚îî @ scope.jl:4
ERROR: LoadError: UndefVarError: m not defined
```

Wait, what happened to `m`?
The warning message tells you.
Change `scope.jl` to the following

```julia
while m > 0
    print("$m ")
    break
end
```

and run it again:

```julia-repl
julia> include("scope.jl")
3
```

This occurs because,
though the `m` in `while m > 0` refers to the `m`
outside the loop that's assigned to `3`,
inside the loop,
`m` hasn't been defined.
So the expression `m - 1` throws an error.
This is different in the REPL,
because a lot of people complained about the scoping rules in the REPL,
and the developers of julia decided
that the convenience was worth the inconsistancy.

Mostly, this doesn't come up in real life,
since in a function, things are a bit different.
The following works in the REPL or in a script.

```julia-repl
julia> function strangewhile(n)
           while n > 0
               print("$n ")
               n = n - 1
           end
           println("") # getting a newline
           println(n)
       end
strangewhile (generic function with 2 methods)

julia> strangewhile(10)
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
0   
```

Loops inside the function have access to the function arguments.
Re-assigning `n` inside the function
changes what the function-scope `n` refers to,
but doesn't leak outside the function.

```julia-repl
julia> strangewhile(10)
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
0

julia> my_n = 5
5

julia> strangewhile(my_n)
5 4 3 2 1
0

julia> my_n
5
```

## Loops and Strings - Strings as containers

Loops can also operate on `String`s,
which are built from `Char`s.

```julia-repl
julia> my_string = "This is a String";

julia> for c in my_string
           println(c)
       end
T
h
i
s

i
s

a

S
t
r
i
n
g
```

We can also access individual parts of a `String`
by "indexing" them.
The syntax for this in julia is to put the index in `[]`.

We can index with individual numbers...

```julia-repl
julia> my_string[1]
'T': ASCII/Unicode U+0054 (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
```

or with ranges...

```julia-repl
julia> my_string[5:8]
" is "
```

Or with the special `end` keyword,
which references the last index of a collection.

```julia-repl
julia> lastindex(my_string)
16

julia> my_string[end]
'g': ASCII/Unicode U+0067 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)

julia> my_string[end-7:end]
"a String"
```

Note
@@
For those of you that have learned other programming languages
like python or java,
you might be confused that the first index is `1` instead of `0`.
That is because julia uses "1-based" indexing.

For those of you that have used R or matlab,
or for those of you that have otherwise never been conditioned
to think of `0` as the first thing,
this is probably intuitive.

Notice that the type of a string indexed by a number
(or the pieces of a `for` loop) is `Char`,

## Kmers

Over the next couple of lessons,
we're going to build some functions that help us to find
and count all of the "kmers" of any length in a sequence,
then use them to help us identify DNA sequences from various organisms.

A "kmer" is a biological sequence (DNA, RNA, or amino acid)
of a given length, $k$.

It is often useful to know the kmer composition
of a sequence, given different values of `k`.
For example, the 2mer (kmers with length 2) composition
of the sequence "ATATATC" is:
- "AT" = 3
- "TA" = 2
- "TC" = 1
 
Note that all reference frames are valid
that is, we don't just march along by 2s.
So the 3mer composition of the same sequence would be
- "ATA" = 2
- "TAT" = 2
- "ATC" = 1

Another way to say this is that the sum of the counts
of all kmers in a sequence must be equal to
the length of the sequence minus $k$ plus 1, or

$\sum{counts_{seq}} = |seq| - k + 1$

## A Brief Introduction to Dictionaries

Earlier, when we wanted to calculate GC content of a DNA sequence,
we looped through a sequence, counted anything that was a `G` or `C`,
and then divided that number by the length of the sequence.

If we want to know the composition of all of the bases in DNA
that would be easy to write out by hand,
because there are only 4 options.
You'll do this for real in Assignment04,
but the [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) might look something like this:

```plaintext
set variables a,c,g,t to 0
for each base in the sequence
    if the base is 'A', add one to `a`
    or if the base is 'C', add one to `c`
    or if the base is 'G', add one to `g`
    or if the base is 'T', add one to `t`
end
return a,c,g,t
```

But doing something like this for proteins,
where each amino acid might be one of 20 options,
or for kmers where the number of possibilities
increases exponentially with `k`
(there are 16 possible DNA 2mers, 64 possible DNA 3mers, etc)
that would be untenable. 

Another option is to use a data structure called a "Dictionary."
What follows is a very brief introduction to dictionaries,
we'll learn more about them next week. 

Dictionaries store data as `key => value` pairs,
where the `key` can be (almost) any type and is used to access
or alter the `value`.
This is probably confusing, but may be clearer with some examples.

```julia-repl
julia> my_dict = Dict("apples"=> 4, "bananas" => 1, "strawberries"=>10)
Dict{String, Int64} with 3 entries:
  "bananas"      => 1
  "apples"       => 4
  "strawberries" => 10
```

Here, the fruits are the `key`s,
and the `Int64s` are the `value`s.
We can access values using the `keys` as the index:

```julia-repl
julia> my_dict["bananas"]
1

julia> my_dict["strawberries"] * 2
20
```

We can check if a dictionary has a particular key
with the boolean function `haskey()`. 

```julia-repl
julia> haskey(my_dict, "apples")
true

julia> haskey(my_dict, "kumquat")
false
```

If we try to access the dictionary with a key that doesn't exist,
we'll get an error.

```julia-repl
julia> my_dict["kumquat"]
ERROR: KeyError: key "kumquat" not found
```

You can use the `get()` function to try to use a key,
and return a default if the key doesn't exist:

```julia-repl
julia> get(my_dict, "bananas", 0)
1

julia> get(my_dict, "kumquat", 0)
0
```

And we can add new entries to the dictionary if we
assign them to new values.

```julia-repl
julia> my_dict["kumquat"] = 0
0

julia> haskey(my_dict, "kumquat")
true
```

And we can update entries by reassigning them,
as if they are variables.

```julia-repl
julia> my_dict["apples"] = my_dict["apples"] + 1;

julia> my_dict["apples"]
5
```

In the assignment,
we'll use dictionaries where the keys are the kmers,
and the values are the counts.
Let's get started!
