## Data Types

Programming can be thought of as consiting of 2 things:

1. Data
2. Operations on data

Everything else is just gravy.

Before continuing,
be sure to read [chapter 2](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html#chap02) of _Think Julia_,
which introduces you to different kinds of values.
The following section will expect you do have read
[chapter 3](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html#chap03),
which introduces you to the operations part (functions).

These chapters also introduce a number of important concepts like
variable assignment, expressions, flow of execution, and arguments.
All of these concepts will come up again and again,
so if you're still a bit fuzzy on them,
that's ok.

### Practice

The following examples are intended to reinforce and extend what you've learned.
In many cases, they are intended to expose behavior that may be unintuitive,
or lead to errors that are worth understanding.

    1. For each of the following expressions,
       What is the `type` of the value that gets returned after execution?
       
```julia-repl
julia> 1+2
3

julia> 3 / 2
1.5

julia> "42 * 6"
"42 * 6"

julia> "42" * "6"
"426"
```
    
   2. Assign each of the values from (1) above to a different variable (eg `my_sum = 1+2`).
       And use the `typeof()` function to test your answers above.
       For example:
       
```julia-repl
julia> x = "42" * "6"
"426"   

julia> typeof(x)
String
```
    
   3. What is the difference between the following expressions?

```julia-repl
julia> "AATTCC"^2
"AATTCCAATTCC"

julia> println("AATTCC"^2)
AATTCCAATTCC
```

What happens if you assign each of these expressions to a variable?

4. What is the difference between `Float64` and `Int64`?
   
   Are there situations where one is obviously preferred over the other
   in a math problem?

5. Without evaluating the following expressions,
   try to guess what the return type will be, `Int64` or `Float64`.

```julia-repl
julia> 1 + 1

julia> 2. - 2.

julia> 3 * 3.

julia> 4. * 4

julia> 5 / 5

julia> "6" + "6.0"

julia> 1e7 + 1
```

    Now evaluate them - did you get them right?
    use `typeof()` if you're not sure.

Tip
@@

When you are working with really big numbers such as `1,000,000`, do not include the commas if you want `julia` to recognize it as an integer. For example, if you were to run this code:

```julia-repl
julia> 1,000,000
(1, 0, 0)
```

you can see that `julia` thinks that `1,000,000` is a group of 3 integers (`1`, `0`, and `0`)!
Instead, `julia` allows you to use underscores to break up large integers.

```julia-repl
julia> 1_000_000
1000000
```

But be careful! ["Overflow"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow)
can occur when you try to use giant numbers.
Watch:

```julia-repl

What happened?
Integers, like all types of data,
are stored in memory as bits -
sequences of `1`s and `0`s.
In julia, the primary integer type is `Int64`,
which uses 64 bits,
63 of which are used for the magnitude,
and one for the sign (`+` or `-`).

The value `2^63` would require 65 bits
to hold in memory.

## Functions

Before continuing,
be sure to read
[chapter 3](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html#chap03)

Functions are the parts of a program that do things.
Without functions, all you have is data.
Actually, most of the time if you want data,
you need functions too,
unless you're writing literally everything by hand.

### Recognizing functions

Functions are bits of code that do things.
Remember the [video from Lesson 1](@ref first-steps)?
(seriously, go back and watch it if you didn't before).
The kids are providing dad a list of functions.

```
get(peanut_butter)
get(jelly)
get(toast)
spread(toast, peanut_butter)
spread(toast, jelly)
```

In julia, it's typically easy to recognize functions because they have the structure:

1. `function_name`
2. `(`
3. `arguments, separated, by, commas`
4. `)`

So in the expression

```julia-repl
julia> println("Hello", " ", "world!")
Hello world!
```

The `function_name` is `println`
and there are 3 arguments (in this case, all `String`s).

But functions show up in other ways too. 
All of the math you were doing in the previous section
was calling functions.
In julia, `1 + 1` is just a convenient syntax[^stx] for `+(1,1)`

```julia-repl
julia> +(42,7)
49

julia> *("BISC", "195")
"BISC195"
```

When you do even simple things like type something in the REPL,
there are functions being called
to evaluate the expression and print the result.

### Variables, arguments, and scope

In chapter 3 of _Think Julia_, you read that
[variables and parameters are local](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html#_variables_and_parameters_are_local)
to functions. 

The more technical way to say that is that the inside of functions
have their own "scope"[^scope].
This will start to become familiar as you write more code,
but it can be confusing at first.

Also potentially confusing is the difference between a `variable`
and an `argument`.
They are similar in various ways,
but treating them in the same way,
_especially naming them the same thing_,
is an easy way to get yourself confused.

Let's see an example:

```julia-repl
julia> function newprint(my_arg)
           println(my_arg, ", students!")
       end
newprint (generic function with 1 method)

julia> newprint("Hello there")
Hello there, students!
```

This should seem pretty straightforward.
The function `newprint()` takes a single argument,
and prints that, appending `", students!"`.
Inside the function,
the value passed as an argument - `"Hello there"` -
is passed in everywhere you see `my_arg`,
but `my_arg` doesn't exist outside the function.

```julia-repl
julia> my_arg
ERROR: UndefVarError: my_arg not defined
```

We could also have passed a _variable_ as the argument.

```julia-repl
julia> gb = "Goodbye"
"Goodbye"

julia> newprint(gb)
Goodbye, students!
```

Same thing - the _variable_ `gb` refers to the _value_ `"Goodbye"`,
and will be substituted everywhere that `my_arg` lives in the function.

Let's look at a slightly more confusing example.

```julia-repl
julia> some_arg = "Woah"
"Woah"

julia> other_arg = "Huzzah"
"Huzzah"

julia> function nelly(some_arg)
           println(some_arg, ", Nelly!")
       end
nelly (generic function with 1 method)

julia> nelly(other_arg)
# ... what do you expect?
```

What do you expect to be the output of `nelly(other_arg)`?

Try it out and see if you're right.
@@

When we call `nelly(other_arg)`,
we're passing the value `"Huzzah"` as the argument.
So _inside_ the scope of the function,
`some_arg` is `"Huzzah"`.

What about `some_arg` outside of the function?

```julia-repl
julia> some_arg
"Woah"
```

Here, we're _outside_ of the function scope,
so `some_arg` is `"Woah"`.

Because of this possibility for confusion,
it's usually a good idea to name your function arguments
and your variables different things. 

@@colbox-green

Tip
@@
Just to reiterate,
use different names for variables that refer to data
and function arguments.

And typically, it's also good practice to make your code "self-documenting",
which means that the names of functions, variables, and arguments
tells you something about what they're used for.

 1. For each of the expressions ending with `# ?`,
    try to predict what the output will be.
    Then, run them in the REPL and see if you were correct.

```julia-repl
julia> x = 4; # putting `;` prevents the "print" part "read-eval-print-loop"

julia> x # ?
```
```julia-repl
julia> y = 2.0;

julia> y + x # ?
```
```julia-repl
julia> z = y * 2;

julia> z # ?
```
 2. Write a function called `multisquare()` that

    - takes **2 arguments**
    - multiplies them together
    - returns the product raised to the second power

    Once you've defined the function,
    you should be able to run

```julia-repl
julia> multisquare(2, 5)
100

julia> multisquare("2","5")
"2525"

julia> multisquare(1,2.0,3.0)
ERROR: MethodError: no method matching multisquare(::Int64, ::Float64, ::Float64)
# ... stack trace

julia> multisquare(1,"2")
ERROR: MethodError: no method matching *(::Int64, ::String)
# ... stack trace
```

    Your output will also contain "stack traces"[^st] for each error.
    Don't worry about trying to understand it right now
    (though it will be very helpful later on).

 3. Both `multisquare(1,2.0,3.0)` and `multisquare(1,"2")` raise `MethodError`s.
    Notice that the former says `no method matching multisquare(...`,
    while the later says `no method matching *(...`"
    What accounts for this difference?

 4. Everything we've done here so far is using `julia`,
    but the same concepts are applicable on the command line too,
    just with different syntax.

    When you change directories with 
    
    ```sh
    $ cd ~/Desktop 
    ```

    `cd` is a function and `~/Desktop` is the argument

    Can you identify the function and the argument(s)
    in the following shell commands?

    ```sh
    $ ls -l ~/Documents
    ```
    ```sh
    $ mv ace-ventura1.mov /home/kevin/Movies
    ```

## Key Terms

[^stx]: **Syntax** - The rules that govern how characters in your code files are translated into instructions that the computer understands. Julia has one kind of syntax, and the shell has another. One of my great hopes for this course is that you'll come to recognize that, though you will learn some syntax for these specific languages, most of the skills you're learning are transferrable to learning any programming language.
[^scope]: **Scope** - The region of a program in which assigned variables are available. In julia, scopes tend to be much more restrictive by default than in other languages. If you ever get an `UndefVarError` when you think that you've actually defined the variable, it's probably not in the right scope.
[^st]: **Stack trace** - This part of error messages can be super daunting at first, especially as your programs get more complicated, but can also be incredibly helpful when debugging. Essentially, they are displaying the [stack diagram](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html#stack_diagrams) for your program where the error occured, including pointing to the specific line in the code files (or REPL block number) where the error occurred.
